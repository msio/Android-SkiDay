# PLEASE FOLLOW THIS GUIDELINES

There are `master` and `dev` branches created. Code is shipped to `master` branch only if it is stable and ready for presentation.
`dev` branch is main branch in development stage but nobody may not commit his code directly to this branch. 
Only way how you can get your code into `dev` branch is by merging your own dev branch into it.

## Naming your own dev branch
### `<yourName>_dev`
If you want you can create more local branches that you merge into your dev branch `<yourName>_dev` but in repository (on github ) you will have just only one `<yourName>_dev`
