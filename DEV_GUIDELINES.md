PLEASE FOLLOW THIS GUIDELINES

There are master and dev branches created. Code is shipped to master branch only if it is stable and ready for presentation.
Dev branch is for main branch in development stage but nobody may not commit his code directly to this branch. 
Only way you how you can get you code into dev branch is by merging your branch into dev branch.
