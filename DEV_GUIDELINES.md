# PLEASE FOLLOW THIS GUIDELINES

There are `master` and `dev` branches created. Code is shipped to `master` branch only if it is stable and ready for presentation.
`dev` branch is main branch in development stage but nobody may not commit his code directly to this branch. 
Only way how you can get your code into `dev` branch is by merging your own dev branch into it.

## Naming your own dev branch
### `<yourName>_dev`
If you want you can create more local branches that you merge into your dev branch `<yourName>_dev` but in repository (on github ) you will have just only one `<yourName>_dev`

## Merging into `dev`
Before merging into `dev`,it is common practice to review your code from other developers. In our case it is only necessary to review the code from just one member of team to prevent some easy bugs
